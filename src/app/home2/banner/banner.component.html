      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        Previously, I worked in mechanical engineering. 
        In that field, it is closely related to programming, 
        which I am very passionate about. In addition, 
        I am also interested in web development, 
        which is closely related to programming, 
        then I took some boot camps and courses.
        So I decided to switch careers to become a Software Engineer. 
        Now I really enjoy my job as a Software Engineer and I am very excited to improve my skills and experience.
